# Employee Excel Import System - Complete Guide

## Overview
This document explains how the Excel import feature works in the Employee Feedback Portal and what data managers see on different screens after importing employee data.

## How Excel Import Works

### 1. Import Process Flow

When a line manager (like Anuja Sonaji) imports an Excel file, the system follows these steps:

**Step 1: File Upload & Validation**
- Manager uploads an Excel file (.xlsx or .xls format)
- System validates file format and structure
- Checks for required columns like Full_Name, Bensl_ID, etc.

**Step 2: Data Processing**
- Reads each row from the Excel file
- Maps Excel columns to database fields
- Validates data and handles missing values
- Creates employee records in the database

**Step 3: Manager Relationship Setup**
- Links employees to their managers using Manager ID (Bensl_ID)
- Sets manager flags for employees who manage others
- Establishes reporting hierarchy

### 2. Required Excel Columns

The system expects these columns in the Excel file:

| Excel Column | Purpose | Example Data |
|--------------|---------|--------------|
| Full_Name | Employee's complete name | "John Smith" |
| Bensl_ID | Unique employee identifier | "JS001" |
| Manager ID | Manager's Bensl_ID | "ANJ001" |
| Manager Name | Manager's full name | "Anuja Sonaji" |
| Team | Department/Team name | "Development" |
| Role | Job role | "Senior Developer" |
| Designation | Job title | "Software Engineer" |
| Emailid | Work email address | "john@company.com" |
| Employment_Type | Type of employment | "Permanent" |
| Employee_Status | Current status | "ACTIVE" |
| Location | Work location | "Mumbai" |
| DOJ Allianz | Date of joining company | "2023-01-15" |
| Grade | Employee grade level | "L4" |
| Gender | Employee gender | "Male" |

### 3. Data Validation & Processing

**Automatic Data Handling:**
- Missing Bensl_ID: System generates unique ID like "GEN_1_John_Smith"
- Default password: All employees get "password123" as initial password
- Manager flags: Employees listed as managers get `is_manager = true`
- Date formatting: Handles multiple date formats automatically
- Duplicate prevention: Skips employees with existing Bensl_IDs

## What Anuja Sonaji Sees After Import

### Dashboard Screen

**Current Status for Anuja Sonaji:**
- **Total Subordinates:** 0 direct reports
- **Total Employees in System:** 57 employees
- **Total Managers:** 10 managers

**Analytics Displayed:**
- Employee distribution by team
- Status breakdown (Active/Inactive employees)
- Gender distribution
- Location distribution
- Recent feedback summary

**Manager-Specific Data:**
- Feedback given this month: 0
- Pending reviews: 0 (since no direct reports)
- Recent feedback entries: None displayed

### Employee List Screen

When Anuja views the employee list, she sees:

**All Employees (57 total)** - Since she's a manager, she can view all employees in the system
- Each employee's basic information
- Name, Role, Team, Manager, Status
- Search and filter capabilities
- Ability to add new employees manually

### Team Hierarchy Screen

**Hierarchy Display:**
- Shows organizational structure
- Anuja appears as a manager node
- Currently shows 0 subordinates under her
- Other managers and their teams are visible

### Import Results Screen

After successful import, Anuja sees:
- **Success message:** "Successfully imported X employees"
- **Skipped records:** Any duplicates or invalid entries
- **Error summary:** Details of any rows that couldn't be processed
- **Processing statistics:** Total processed vs skipped

## Data Population Logic

### 1. Dashboard Analytics Calculation

```
For Current User (Anuja):
- Direct Reports = Employees where manager_id = Anuja's ID
- Subordinates = All employees in her reporting chain
- Scope = Direct reports + All subordinates + Self
- Analytics calculated only for employees in scope
```

### 2. Manager Assignment Logic

```
During Import:
1. Read Manager ID from Excel (Bensl_ID of manager)
2. Find manager in database using Bensl_ID
3. Set employee.manager_id = manager.id
4. Set manager.is_manager = true
5. Update employee.manager_name = manager.full_name
```

### 3. Access Control Rules

**Manager Access:**
- Can view all employees in the system
- Can import new employee data
- Can give feedback to any employee
- Can view dashboard analytics

**Employee Access:**
- Limited to own profile only
- Cannot access import functionality
- Cannot view other employees

## Current Data for Anuja Sonaji

Based on the database:

**Profile Information:**
- Name: Anuja Sonaji
- Bensl_ID: ANJ001 (and CF9RFCI - appears to have duplicate records)
- Team: Development (and UFS)
- Manager Status: Yes (is_manager = true)
- Direct Reports: 0 employees

**Why 0 Subordinates:**
- No employees in the database have Anuja's Bensl_ID as their Manager ID
- This could be because:
  1. Import hasn't been done yet with employees reporting to her
  2. Manager ID mapping in Excel doesn't match her Bensl_ID
  3. She's a new manager with no direct reports assigned yet

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Import Issues:
1. **"No subordinates showing"** - Check Manager ID column in Excel matches manager's Bensl_ID exactly
2. **"Duplicate employee errors"** - Employee with same Bensl_ID already exists
3. **"Missing data warnings"** - Required fields like Full_Name are empty

### Dashboard Issues:
1. **"No analytics data"** - No employees assigned to manager yet
2. **"Empty team view"** - Manager hierarchy not properly established
3. **"Access denied"** - User doesn't have manager privileges

## Best Practices for Excel Import

1. **Always use the template** - Download the provided Excel template
2. **Verify Manager IDs** - Ensure Manager ID column contains valid Bensl_IDs
3. **Check for duplicates** - Remove any duplicate employee records before import
4. **Validate email addresses** - Ensure all email formats are correct
5. **Review after import** - Check dashboard and employee list to verify data

## Next Steps After Import

1. **Verify employee data** - Check if all employees imported correctly
2. **Set up team structures** - Ensure manager-employee relationships are correct
3. **Configure feedback cycles** - Set up regular feedback schedules
4. **Train employees** - Provide login credentials and system training
